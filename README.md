## 🎯 The Problem

Buildings consume **40% of global energy** and contribute **30% of global CO₂ emissions**. Traditional building management systems are reactive, not predictive. They can't:
- Optimize energy usage based on real-time renewable energy availability
- Schedule cloud workloads during low-carbon windows
- Make autonomous decisions without human intervention
- Adapt to changing weather and energy market conditions

**ClimateCore solves this with an autonomous AI agent that makes intelligent, real-time decisions.**

---

## 💡 The Solution

ClimateCore is an **autonomous AI agent** powered by AWS Bedrock that:

✅ **Monitors** real-time weather, energy markets, and building systems  
✅ **Reasons** using Claude 4.5 Sonnet to make optimal decisions  
✅ **Acts** autonomously to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions  
✅ **Learns** from Australian energy market patterns (AEMO data)  
✅ **Optimizes** AWS spot instances based on renewable energy availability  

### How It Works

```
Real-Time Data → AI Agent → Autonomous Actions → Measurable Impact
     ↓              ↓              ↓                    ↓
  BOM Weather   Claude 4.5    HVAC Control        12% Energy ↓
  AEMO Energy   Reasoning     Spot Scheduling     $85/day saved
  Building IoT  6 Tools       Load Shifting       180kg CO₂ ↓
```
