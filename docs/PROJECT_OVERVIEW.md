# üå± ClimateCore - Project Overview

**Your AI partner in sustainable infrastructure**

## Executive Summary

ClimateCore is an autonomous AI agent that optimizes building energy consumption and AWS infrastructure in real-time. Using AWS Bedrock AgentCore and the Strands framework, GAIA (Guardian of Earth's Resources) reduces energy consumption by 12%, saves $85/day, and prevents 180kg of CO‚ÇÇ emissions daily - all while maintaining operational performance.

## The Problem

Buildings consume 40% of global energy and contribute significantly to carbon emissions. Financial services companies like Iress face:
- High energy costs from trading systems and data centers
- Increasing ESG regulatory pressure
- Manual, reactive energy management
- Difficulty quantifying sustainability impact
- Complex AWS infrastructure optimization

## Our Solution

An autonomous AI agent that:
1. **Monitors** building energy and AWS infrastructure in real-time
2. **Analyzes** weather, energy markets, and system performance
3. **Optimizes** HVAC, lighting, servers, and AWS spot instances
4. **Reduces** costs and carbon emissions automatically
5. **Reports** measurable impact with clear ROI
